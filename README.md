# tech_product_assessment

This straightforward python program creates rankings and ratings based on metrics from products within a technology branch. 
The metrics are all divided in categories and these categories have an importance rating.

The weights and metrics are defined in the Excel file, just like the measurements of the products.

Running this program on the data will create rankings and rating within every category and a "Total" ranking and rating. In addition to that the program creates a tool where the impact of every category can be adjusted and visualized.
